# PathVisualizer
A Java app for Windows (however will probably run on Linux) that renders paths. This is currently under development by FRC Team 3695 as part of our autonomous driving system called Hyperdrive. **This repository is now legacy and will no longer be updated.** You can find the updated PathVisualizer in our newer [*Hyperdrive*](https://github.com/BTK203/Hyperdrive) repository.
