# PathVisualizer Client Test Program
This program exists as a prototype for the PathVisualizer robot project (PathVisualizer/PathVisualizerClient/robotProject) and allows for easy testing of new features of the application.
The Java app will allow you to connect to PathVisualizer and send robot positions and paths. More features can be easily added.
